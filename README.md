# php-form-helper

A PHP 5.3 Form helper class.

It's late, I can't sleep, and I'm sick of those
uselessly complicated form classes out there.

## Features

- No html elements rendering
- No validators
- No form decorators
- No widgets
- No extensions
- No documentation (just look at the `sample.php` file)
- 45 sloc you can read without a dedication
- **_This fork modified by Jordan Lev: added a `select_options` helper; removed tests and composer file._**
